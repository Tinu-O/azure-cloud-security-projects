1. Deploy Microsoft Sentinel in an Azure workspace  
2. Connect data sources (Azure AD, Office 365, Security logs)  
3. Configure built-in Analytics rules  
4. Create a custom detection rule (e.g., failed logins)  
5. Test alerts and incidents in Sentinel

## Screenshots  
(Add screenshots of each step here as you complete them in Azure)
